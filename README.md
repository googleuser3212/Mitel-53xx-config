This File contains a sample config file for the Mitel 53xx series phones. This file is a sample. You will need to change things in the file to make it work. This is for if you cannot get the web config utility to work. Please review the file carefully. The things you will need to change are filled with a placeholder CHANGEME, which you can find. It will also have some context to what the parameter wants.  You need to rename the file to MN_MAC.cfg, replacing the MAC with the phone's MAC address. You will need to have a TFTP server set up, and you will need to have a way to point the phone towards the server. Please check my discord, or email me at 3212onyt@gmail.com for assistance.
